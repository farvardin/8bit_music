This library can simulate the MOS SID soundchip (used on C64
8-bit computers).
It is based on other developpers work (see credits in the file 
headers)

The schematic is based on the one used in the Cheap Synth project. See http://www.fakebitpolytechnic.com/cheapsynth-external-module/

There is a fritzing schematic in
